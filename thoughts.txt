Need to look for marker in gauge area + some buffer (to catch cases where it's on the edge)
Once we find the gauge it shouldn't move too much each frame. Can do tracking to check previous frame area + buffer.
 - But if we lose it for too long then we have to actually look again

The target image is bright, which messes up the thresholding and we end up losing the gauge
